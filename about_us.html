    <h3>Company Info</h3>
    <p>Anthony's Travel Agency was founded originally in 1943, when a group of Continental Airlines
        Employees left to found their own travel company. It all started with about 6 guys and no planes, but 
        has since expanded to a team of hundreds with locations around the continental United States, with a collection
        of private jet-liner aircraft.</p>
